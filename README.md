A collection of responsive email templates coded in MJML and available on [mjml.io/templates](https://mjml.io/templates).

## Fixing a template 

Some of those templates could do with a good clean and we truly appreciate help. If you see any error 
in a template or a way to enhance a template, feel free to submit a pull-request with your changes.

## Submitting a template

We love showcasing our community's work! If you want to have your template featured on the website, 
feel free to submit your own MJML template (with a `.xml` file extension) as a pull-request in this repo.
